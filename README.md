# NYC Yellow Taxicab

## Project McNulty

#### Back story:
Using either data from the web (API or scraped) or one of the optional supplied data sets (possibly in conjunction with your own data), what can we learn via supervised learning techniques? Optionally extend your findings with a flask website and/or D3 visualization.

Note you can work within a 'company' (with other folks working on the same data source as you) for brainstorming, design, additional data and code sharing will be highly encouraged. However, the final projects will be individual.

#### Data:
* **acquisition:** download, api's, scraping, etc.
* **storage:** PostgreSQL
* **sources:** (see sql_data_sets for descriptions and links to data.)

* NYC Transportation
* Traffic Fatalities
* US Health Insurance Marketplace
* Militarized Interstate Disputes
* Sports, Sports, and More Sports!
* The Simpson's
* Climate Change
* Python StackOverflow Questions

#### Skills & Tools:
* supervised learning
* SQL
* flask
* javascript/D3

#### Analysis:
* SQL and supervised machine learning are required
* flask and javascript/D3 are optional

#### Deliverable/communication:
* organized project repository
* slide presentation
* visual and oral communication in presentations
* write-up of process and results

#### Design:
* iterative design process
* "MVP"s and building outward

#### More information:
Data sources for this project are all about options. We can choose from a number of pre-selected data sets. We can also use our own data (either scraped from the web or pulled from api's) or supplement the pre-selected data with some of our own. Either way, we will be honing our database skills by storing data in PostgreSQL and doing some of our analysis there.[^1]

[^1]: If the project does not have a significant SQL component, then additional (intermediate and advanced) SQL challenges should be completed.

We'll also learn about many supervised learning methods that can be used to predict outcomes for our projects. And we can showcase those results with a flask website or D3 visualization.
